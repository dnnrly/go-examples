# go-examples

This is a space where we will explore different topics in Go. I'm doing this because I learn by doing mostly. But also because when I need to read up, I prefer worked examples.

This space will hopefully explore some of the more advanced topics in Go. Well, the things that *I* struggle with anyway. :)
